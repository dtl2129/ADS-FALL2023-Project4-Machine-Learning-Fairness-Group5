### Project Summary
In this project, we focused on tasks A3 (Maximizing fairness under accuracy constraints (gamma and Fine-gamma)) and A7 (Information Theoretic Measures for Fairness-aware Feature Selection (FFS)). Our primary objective was to conduct a comparative analysis of gamma, Fine-gamma, and FFS, assessing their effectiveness and efficiency in various scenarios.

### Contribution Statements
- All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
- **Yucheng Lu:** Implemented algorithm A7 and meticulously compared the accuracy of various feature combinations to identify the most effective model. This process involved extensive data analysis and rigorous testing of multiple models under different conditions, leveraging advanced statistical methods for objective performance evaluation.
- **Noreen Mayat:** Helped organize Github, reviewed and revised code for A3 and A7 to fix bugs, enhance performance and make the code more organized, with background information, as well as more concise and straightforward. Worked on editing and combining A3 and A7 into one joint file. Added more detail to READMEs for each folder. Added figure to figures folder.
