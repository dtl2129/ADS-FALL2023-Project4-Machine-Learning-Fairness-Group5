### Project Summary
In this project, we focused on tasks A3 (Maximizing fairness under accuracy constraints (gamma and Fine-gamma)) and A7 (Information Theoretic Measures for Fairness-aware Feature Selection (FFS)). Our primary objective was to conduct a comparative analysis of gamma, Fine-gamma, and FFS, assessing their effectiveness and efficiency in various scenarios.

### Contribution Statements
- All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
- **Yucheng Lu:** Implemented algorithm A7 and meticulously compared the accuracy of various feature combinations to identify the most effective model. This process involved extensive data analysis and rigorous testing of multiple models under different conditions, leveraging advanced statistical methods for objective performance evaluation.
- **Noreen Mayat:** Helped organize Github, reviewed and revised code for A3 and A7 to fix bugs, enhance performance and make the code more concise and organized, with detailed background information, as well as more comprehensive and straightforward. Worked on editing and combining A3 and A7 into one joint file. Added more detail to READMEs for each folder. Added figure to figures folder. Finalized submission details by working on combining the task code for final draft and then converting to HTML and PDF format. 
- **Hannah Gao:** Worked on implementing and revising A7, specifically with vD, fairness-utility score for each feature, calibration, and Shapley value functions. Added detailed formulas and explanations to make it more comprehensive. Reached out to all group members and initiated a group chat with every one's availability. Also added more details to READMEs. 
- **Daniel Thomas Luce:** Started up the Github to kickstart group progress. Worked on modifying and revising A7; created a visualization graphic for this work to better understand our findings. 
- **Bessie Wang:** Worked on implementing and revising A7. Added detailed explanations of formulas and calculations conducted. 
- **Yufei Wang:** Implemented almost all of A3, including training an unconstrained classifier on the biased data and optimizing fairness subject to accuracy constraints. Suggested ideas about comparing A3 to A7 and adjusted the code to make them more comparable. Worked on presentation, and presented on behalf of the group,
